        <h2>Chapter 1: How On Earth?</h2>
        <p>No Shadow

            Once upon a time, there was a boy who was missing his shadow. He was very sad because other kids, they had a shadow, but not him. “Why oh why don’t I have a shadow” the boy repeated over and over again. He walked home moping “Kevin! Dinner is ready!” said his mom. Kevin was fourteen and a half years old. He ate his dinner and went to rest. While he was dreaming, three grumpy trolls took him and his bed and threw him into a river! On his bed/boat he floated down the stream. In a short while he woke up, suddenly realizing he was in a cave! He came up on a portal. He tried to swim away, but the current was too strong! Kevin went into the portal like a helpless spider going down the bathtub drain. He came out looking at a sign that had “Circuland” written on it. “Hey! Who are you?” came a voice from behind. Kevin looked around and saw three circles, with feet! And eyes and a mouth and even a star hovering above their heads! Two boys and one girl. Yellow, blue, and red. The blue one with a headband and the red one looking sad with a slight smirk. “Hey stinky! Who are you!?” said the blue one. “Uh… uh… Kevin.” replied you know who. “Where are you from?” said the yellow one, “you don’t look like you are from around here.” “well duh!” replied Kevin. “And don’t mind if I ask, who are you?” “i’m Clumo” said the yellow one. “And these are my younger siblings Clume, and Cluma.” Kevin stood up, and suddenly, Clumo shrieked and ran away. “”No! Clumo! Don’t go!” Kevin yelled back. Cluma and Clume looked in the direction Clumo went for a few seconds then ran after him. Kevin followed. When he eventually got to what he thought was Clumo’s house, he went inside. “Clumo! Clumo! Clumo where are you?” he said as he was searching the little cottage for the little creature. Suddenly, a little head popped out of a corner (it was Clumo, in case you didn’t know) “ oh Clumo, hi,” said Kevin. “Oh, hi, and don’t say ‘oh, Clumo hi,’ to me,” said Clumo mockingly. “Oh and I also have something to show you! Follow me”. They went up some stairs and came into a room with an old-fashioned desk with a swivel chair and on the other side was a triple bunk bed and a small window. “Come,” said Clumo. “I think I know what your problem is and how to fix it.” “No way!” Kevin said, surprised. It was a book. He picked up the large book and Clumo said “turn to page 85”. So Kevin did just that. The page said:
            
            <i>One day there will be a boy who travels from another world, the world of Serania. This boy will be missing his shadow. He shall seek an ancient gift that will not only give him his shadow, but destroy Gammon too.</i>  
            Kevin ended it with a simple, “what on earth?”
            </p>
            <h2>Chapter 2: A Secret Discovered</h2>
            <p>“Clumo, what is this?” Kevin asked. “I feel a strange connection to it.” “it is a prophecy,” Clumo explained. “It is about our savior, our savior from Gammon, the evil wizard.
                I think you might be the boy who would save us from the wizard. Oh and by the way, where are you from?”
                “uh… uh… I'm from Serania” Kevin replied curiously. “You must be the savior!” Clumo said as he ran down the stairs. “Clume! Cluma! I have big news…” his voice slowly faded away.
                Kevin thought for a moment then followed after Clumo. Suddenly a loud Bang! Bang! Bang! Came rushing through the house. “It’s coming from the door!” said Clume. “I’ll go get it”
                He opened the door and screamed like a girl and ran and hid behind Kevin. “It’s Robumo!” shouted Clume.
                “Help me!” came a robot-like voice from the droid so called Robumo.
                “Let him in!” cried Cluma.
                When Robumo came in he looked like a black version of Clumo with a robotic voice, yellow eyes dimmed in places to make what seemed to be the pupils.
                “Papero has disappeared! And the paper versions of me and you guys!” exclaimed Robumo.
                He turned and looked at Kevin “Oh, who are you?”
                “I'm Kevin,” he replied. “I’m from Sarania!” “Sarania!” Robumo exclaimed “are you the savior?” 
               “I might be,” replied Kevin. “I’m not so sure yet. All I know is that a new secret has been discovered.” And with that simple phrase, he ended 
               Chapter 2.
               </p>
               <h2>Chapter 3: The Portal</h2>
               <p>“How can I be the savior?” said Kevin. “All I have is a nonexistent  shadow.” “You don’t need a shadow to be the savior, plus, we all have shadows like yours,” said Clumo. “But I will need to show you something to start your journey, follow me.” Clumo walked out of the cottage and Kevin and the rest followed. Clumo came out of a shed with a small dome-like object. “It’s called the holodome,” said Clumo. “It’s from Endor!” “That sounds like something from Star Wars,” said Kevin. “It’s a show on TV.” “I have absolutely no idea what that is,” said Clumo. “But, it sounds
                cool. Now, to operate this portal device you’d have to have been there, I already took it to grassy plains, go on, push the button.” Kevin pushed the button till it made a “click” sound . The dome made the sound a lightsaber makes when you ignite it. The dome showed a loading sign then a few milliseconds later a face appeared as a holographic image.
               
               “Hello” said the holodome. “My name is TC–23, it is nice to meet you!” “uhhhhhh… hi?” said Kevin. “My name is Kevin. I would like to visit the grassy plains.” “OK, step inside the circle along with anyone you want to come with.” said TC–23 to the others. When a projected circle appeared on the ground, everyone stepped into it. “Ready?” asked the holodome. “You betcha!” replied Kevin. The world started spinning and spinning and then turned white, a strong woosh of air came and they were in the plains! And then they saw something, what was it? Find out in the next chapter.
               </p>
               <h2>Chapter 4: The Thing</h2>
               <p>“Uh, Clumo, what is that?” said Kevin, worried. “It’s a rinophalys!” said Clumo. “And they are dangerous, RUN!” They all ran to a barn hoping it would give them at least some shelter from this giant beast. Finally they were safe, or so they thought. Suddenly the rinophalys broke down the barn door! Kevin and the others made their way out a broken window. Kevin pressed the button on TC-23 and the familiar sound of a lightsaber igniting played “yo Kevin, where would you like to go?” asked TC-23. “Back to that cave where we found you! Quickly!” “OK” said TC-23. They stepped in the circle and the world started spinning and turned white then the woosh of air came and they were in the cave. They all stood there, panting for a few minutes and then walked home.
            </p>
            <h2>Chapter 5: The Crystal</h2>
            <p>On their way to the cottage, the new group of friends walks by the crystal caverns. A deep canyon thousands of years old! Suddenly, Kevin slips and falls down the canyon. He falls down into the deep crevice, when he finally reaches the bottom, he falls into a pool of rainwater, “Uh, guys!” yells Kevin trying to communicate with the surface. “I’m down here! I’m alive!” no answer came. “TC-23!” thought Kevin as he reached into his pocket. You know what happens, lightsaber sound = on. “He-he-he-hello m-master Kev-v-n” says TC-23. “S-self diagnostics sh-show that I-I-I-I-I-I have  been-n da-da-da-da-damaged f-from th-e-e fall” the projection flickered and alas TC finally said, “I-I-I-I can’t-t-t teleport-port you, any-anywhere. But I-I can-n provide a-a light.” “Well something is better than nothing,” said Kevin. “Ok a light will do.” they walked through the cavern. Suddenly, a creature popped out of a hole in the wall! “TC! What is that!?” shouted Kevin. “Scanning,” said TC-23. “It is a houndrick, recent studies show that they are violent, ruthless, carnivores that will stop at nothing to get their pre—” “ok, not helping,” said Kevin, worried. “Any weaknesses?” “Well, now that you mention it,” said TC-23 to Kevin. “See that crystal on its head” “uh huh” “it’s really fragile, if you break it it it should be unconscious while it’s building a new crystal, which usually takes 2-3 weeks.” Kevin grabbed a rock and threw it at the houndrick’s crystal and the crystal broke. The houndrick spun around and fell down. “YES!” shouted kevin. “Now, next things next, we need to get out of here.” “GET ME OUT OF HERE!” said a mysterious voice. Gong! Suddenly everything went black.
            </p>
            <h2>Chapter 6: The Pineapple</h2>
            <p>“Oh my head.” said Kevin, who’d been hit on the head.
                He woke up upside down in a dark cave and couldn’t get past the feeling he was being watched.
                Suddenly a black shadow appeared running in the corner.
                “Who’s there!?” said Kevin.
                “Oh, hey it’s me, the pineapple man” said the shadow as he came into the light. 
                He was an old guy with a British accent, missing some teeth, and his breath smelled like garlic
                “Where am I?” asked Kevin. “You’re in the pineapple.” said the man. “Wha?” said Kevin. “No, literally, you’re inside a giant pineapple.” said the man. “If I wasn’t just attacked by a rynophalys this would probably be the weirdest thing I’ve seen today,” said Kevin. “Now, if you don’t mind me asking, where is the exit?” “Death is your only exit” said the man “sacrifice! Sacrifice! SACRIFICE!” the man shouted for absolutely no reason whatsoever. Then, again, everything went black.
                </p>
                <h2>Chapter 7: The Escape</h2>
                <p>It was about a day before Kevin woke up, and when he did, he found himself above a pool of lava. He heard the man say, “prepare to DIE!” The man pulled down a lever and Kevin was slowly lowered down. And just as he was a few inches above the lava, He remembered TC-23! “Come on TC please work” the lightsaber sound was heard. “K-k-kevin I told you, I c-c-can’t teleport you any—” gonk! Kevin hit TC-23 and there was a flash of light and they were in the grassy plains! The place where they were attacked by the rynophalys. Then he saw a yellow ball in the distance. CLUMO! Kevin ran and ran as fast as he could towards the yellow ball, and as he got closer to him, he heard Clumo shouting, “kevin! Kevin! KEVIN!” Here I am, Kevin replied.  “Wow what happened! I thought you’d been eaten by a dudezilla!” “That did not happen, and what is a dudezilla?” Kevin asked. “I’ll tell you later, so, what did happen?” Clumo asked. Kevin told him the whole story. “So, you’re saying a man with a British accent and garlic breath tried to murder you?”
