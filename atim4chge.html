        <p>A Time For Change #1

            Chapter 1: School, Again.
            Kyle woke up before the alarm again, 6:45, Kyle sighed knowing that he wouldn't be able to go back to sleep "just 45 minutes" Kyle thought. I should get ready. So he got ready and in 45 minutes he made it to the bus stop. His best friend Xavier was already there. "Hello dude how ya doin'?" asked Xavier."Not too shabby." replied Kyle. They waited there for about ten minutes before the bus came. When the bus came they both got on and went to the back as the older kids do. They were trying so hard to act big like some of the older middle schoolers,though, they were only in seventh grade. As soon as Kyle sat down he took out his iPhone and opened Youtube even though he was in seventh grade, he was one of the only kids with a phone. Xavier being the other.
            
            ---ðŸ•–---
            
            When the bus stopped, Kyle and Xavier got off and went to school and did their classes untill the earthquake happened.
            
            Chapter 2: The Earthquake
            Kyle and Xavier both walked to class and sat down at their desks the class started and their teacher, Mr. Devacio, said that they would be starting a new unit, "today and for the next few months we will be going over a very strange topic: TIME TRAVEL." he had said. just then all of a sudden a loud but low rumble shook the school then they noticed that the whole school was empty, exept for Kyle and Xavier, then the school colapsed Kyle barely had time to scream.
            
            Chapter 3: WOOSH! (â€¢â€¿â€¢)
            Am I dead? Kyle thought. KYLE... Kyle heard a voice calling his name. Creepy... Kyle thought. COME KYLE, OVER HERE. There it was again! He decided to follow it. After a while he heard it again, KYLE, IT IS TIME, TIME FOR YOU TO DIEEEEEEEE! just then a figure leapt out from the dark and tackled him, "dude I got you good!!!" Shouted the figure. Kyle realized that it was Xavier "MAN!THAT IS NOT COOL!!!" replied Kyle. "let's keep walking and see if we can find a way out of here" They kept walking and saw something shiny. They went over to investigate and saw two gold coins. Xavier picked one up and instantly he vanished! in curiousity Kyle picked the other one up and he saw a woosh of light that looked kind of like going into hyperspace in StarWars he soon landed in a heap with the air knocked out of him.
            
            Chapter 4: Vikings
            Kyle woke up to the sound of Xavier panicking "v...vvvv...viii... VIKINGS!!!" Kyle got up with a start then he saw it too. It was a person with a old worn out tunic blond hair and blue eyes. "Wavarnic arni akai" the person said. "what?" Kyle said to Xavier when all of a sudden the two gold coins floated and stuck to their skin. Suddenly the man spoke again, "who are you? and, why are you dressed so weird?" Oh, so the coins are time machines and translators. Kyle thought. Xavier stood up and his phone fell out. The viking quickly grabbed the phone before Xavier could grab it.
            It turned on and lit up. He looked at it wide eyed as he touched the screen. He messed with the phone and activated the camera and turned on the flashlight "You are evil sorcerers! I will tell everyone about you unless you explain yourselves." "Xavier, we have to tell him." Said Kyle. So they told him every thing. "If you really are travelers from the future prove it show me, or, i'll tell everyone." Xavier sighed and without thinking he he grabbed his coin and grabbed the man's hand, and they disapeared. So, Kyle followed.
            
            Chapter 5: You're telling me there are flush toilets!?
            "Are you mad!?" yelled Kyle across this hyperspace-like-tube."we shouldn't bring people from the past!!!" "well he was going to tell everyone about us!" replied Xavier. "well now we're giveing him more to tell on!" replied Kyle. "ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!" the man was screaming, clearly surprised that he was flying through time and space.
            They landed in a small pile outside the school. "hey, I never got your name." Kyle said to the viking. "Eric." the viking said with a surprised tone. Wide-eyed Eric got up. It apeared as if he was beign electrocuted. Radio signals, Kyle thought.He's not used to them. Kyle and Xavier waited while Eric got his bearings.
            After Eric got his bearings they went to explore the wonders of modern technology. "Is that a horseless carriage!?" Eric had said, or, "Is that a fireless candle!?" or "you're telling me there are flush toilets!?" Nothing was going wrong.....Yet.
            
            Chapter 6: Leif
            Leif Erickson was walking through the woods, looking for his father. "Father, father! Where are you? Mother says that it is dinner time."  Leif kept looking, "Father!" He walked through the woods and found this gold coin with a note attached to it, LEIF, it said. he grabbed it and opened it.
            
            YOU ARE ONE OF THE CHOSEN ONES, HOLD YOUR COIN, AND FULFILL YOUR DESTINY, TO BE A TIME CHILD.
            
            Leif stared intently at the note. Is this really for me? He thought. He picked up the coin to examine it and as soon as he did he was wooshed through time, through a tube that looked a lot like hyperspace from StarWars. He landed in a room that looked as if it was a spaceship with technology he had never seen before. "Welcome to the time terminal." said a voice, but there was no one there.
            
            Chapter 7: The Time Terminal
            "All right, Eric, time to go home." said Kyle. "oh, all right, let's go." said Eric with a hint of disapointment. Xavier grabbed his coin and held on to Eric and they dissapeared. So, as always, Kyle followed.
            
            ---ðŸ•–---
            
            They landed but they didn't land back in the viking age, they landed in a room that seemed as if it were a laboratory. "welcome to the time terminal"
            said a computerized voice. A door opened and the kids went in, all of a sudden Eric ran to Someone, "Son!" he called. "Father!" the man replied. Just then Kyle realized that the man was more of a teenager no older than 14. Eric inroduced Kyle and Xavier to the boy. "Greetings, I am Leif Erikson."
            "Kyle, If this is Leif Erikson and that guy is his father," Xavier pointed to Eric. "That means that Eric is actually Eric the red!" "Eric the who?" Kyle asked, but before Xavier could answer, a man in a white cloak came into the room, "Welcome to the time terminal, I am GEN247, your guide through time and space." said the man. "You may not know it yet but you are actually speaking in different languages. Your coins allow you to understand eachother." GEN247 looked at Kyle and Xavier and wispered a secret message, "Kyle, Xavier, come."  The boys came. They walked through hallways that seemed endless. They were all white and plated with some kind of metal. For lighting, all they had was long florecent lights. They stopped and turned into a room and they all sat down on stools, or at least floating objects that resembled stools. "You guys know who Eric The Red, right." said GEN247, the boys nodded."The guy who first discovered Greenland, yes. Then you must know that since you took him out of time Greenland was never dicovered---" "And your point is?" inturupted Kyle. "You need to return Eric to his own time, NOW." replied GEN247, sternly but without a hint of anoyence. "Well that'll be easy!" said Kyle and Xavier at the same time.
            
            Chapter 8: High ho! Back in time we go!
            Kyle, Xavier, and GEN247 walked back to the room where  Eric and Leif were and when they did Kyle asked GEN247, "Hey GEN247 is a little long, can we just call you Gen?" "Sure, but, you'd be surprized how long my actual name is." replied Gen. "And what is that?" asked Leif. "GENERATION2473082663028710274566389729828722729729B." "And who named you that?" asked Eric. "My maker, Artham Arthamious Zandaruanian The Five millionth." "There were five million arthams!" Said Kyle in surprise. "Yes the model before me was very mass produced." replied Gen. "All right Eric, time to go home." said Xavier. "I guess I should go," said Eric."come on Leif!" "No." replied Leif. "No?" said Eric, confused."I am a time child,whatever that means, I need to learn what it means." "but, you have to come." "don't worry father i'll be there, you'll hardly realize i'm gone." "He's right, the coins are time machines, so, we can zap Leif in to the time you come back." asured Gen. "oh all right, but, I want Kyle and Xavier to take me home." said Eric. "is that ok with you boys?" asked Gen. "Sure!" replied Kyle and Xavier. In that instant they began their journey through time.
            
            ---ðŸ•–---
            
            Though it felt like forever inside the hyperspace-like-tube, it didn't take any time at all. When they landed they landed in the middle of the viking villiage, Kyle felt a rush of panic before he realized that the town had been deserted. Just then he heard Gen's voice coming from the coin. "Kyle, is the town empty?" "yeah." replied Kyle. Just then Eric diss apeared. Kyle gasped in shock. At the sound, Xavier shot up from the ground. "I just took Eric back to his own time." anounced Gen. " 'till next we meet, i'll call you when I need you again, untill then, farwell."
            
            Chapter 9" home again
            
            While the boys were wooshing throught time Kyle's mom got a call from the school principal telling her to come immediately. How did he get in trouble this time, she thought. She got into the car and set off.
            when she got to the school, she saw the pile of rubble. How many kids are stuck under there? She thought. She also saw, out of the corner of her eye, Kyle. She immediately stopped the car and ran to embrace him. she wrapped him in her arms and gave him a kiss on the cheek."Mom," gasped Kyle."you're crushing my lungs." "Sorry," his mom said."is your friend okay?" "yeah,Xavier is fine." replied Kyle. "Alright, let's go home." said Kyle's mom. Kyle agreed, he couldn't wait to see what his mom was making for dinner.
