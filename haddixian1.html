            Chapter 1: A Brief Intro to the World of Haddixia and SeaPort
            
            The land of the haddix was vast, large, and wide. With the Peterson territorry to the north and the Canner territory to the south. with the Green Sea all around. War constantly raged on between the Peterson and Canner territory. Our story starts in the small town of SeaPort*. where Jacob lives.
            SeaPort was a small town near the cliff edge of the Green Sea. With the town library, (Box'n'Books) as the northern most building, and the only inn, (SeaPort's only inn) to the south. Jacob lives way in the outskirts of the town in a rundown shack as an orphan, but little does he know that he has a rare power that very few people have.
            
            Chapter 2: the Shack
            
            Jacob woke up to the crisp fall morning air. Jacob was freezing, wondering "will I survive this winter?". For homeless orphans, that was always up for debate. after about 5 minutes of just laying there, he got up. Jacob sliped into his worn out boots, put on his coat, stuck on his hat, and began to walk to town. 
            When Jacob walked into town, he was greeted by John, his best friend and (sadly) fellow orphan. As he walked, he envyously watched other portfolk useing their helixes* to repair windows or give a drink to a pet or to make plants grow or to bring sun to their crops! "I really miss my parents**" Jacob mumbled.
            
            *Helixes, plural for Helix, are a mystical force. They allow Haddix to control elements in their inviroment. Such as: fire, water, earth, and wind.
            **Jacob had lost his parents when he was 3 (not old enough to use a helix) in the Great SeaPort Fire (27th day of the 2nd month of the 98th year of the 3rd epoch) Jacob, in his grief had not used his helix. For he was too sad.
            
            
            
            Chapter 3:the Competition
            
            Jacob was walking silently for what seemed like a long time untill all of a sudden John said "how come you've never used your helix?" "well, I-"John cut Jacob off, "here's an idea, how 'bout a competition? whoever can do the most with their helix wins!" Jacob felt obligated to agree so he did.
            Jacob was at the compitition about to use his helix for the first time when John shot a fire blast* out of his hands. Jacob, having never used his helix before, was nervous. When it was his turn Jacob got up and willed with all his might to use his helix until a giant gust of wind came out of his hands! Great, i'm a wind helix, he thought, untill all of a sudden a blast of water came out of his hands. A double helix**! then as soon as he thought this, plants began growing around his feet, and fire began to come out of his hands. "Woah," he said as John looked at him with surprise.
            *John was a fire helix.
            **a double helix was a special rare power for haddix who were born with two helixes.
            
            Chapter 4: the eyes
            
            Jacob stood there in surprise for a few moments before noticeing the eyes in the woods. As soon as he noticed the eyes, they came out of the woods. It was a man who was not from SeaPort. Roughly six feet tall and very muscular. That was all he could see before the man took him into the woods. He faintly remembered John yelling "JAAAAYYYYYCOOOB!".
            ---hellodude---(John's story)
            John watched in amazement as Jacob used multiple helixes. When Jacob was done he saw the eyes in the trees. He tried to warn Jacob but was too afraid to talk. Then Jacob was taken. "JAAAAYYYYYCOOOB!" he yelled. Five secconds before he was taken too.
            
            Chapter 5: where?
            
            Jacob woke up again in a dark room. He winced as he got up because his back ached. There was a window in the small dark room he was in. so he looked out of it. He was in the woods in a tree house about 20 feet off the ground. He looked to his side and saw John (still unconcious) laying there. Then the man came into the room.
            "come" the man said. "I need to show you something." "i'm not going anywhere with you" said Jacob, so the man took Jacob into another room against his will. "STOP, STOP!" Jacob yelled but the man didn't listen. after what seemed like hours of pathways and corridors, the man strapped him into a chair/prison cell and sat down on the floor. He just sat there silently for a few minutes untill the man said, "i'm sorry, but i'm afraid I have not properly introduced myself. The name's Gavin, Gavin Wendolyn." "well nice to meet you" said Jacob, sarcasticly. "I saw what you did back there, at first I thought I was seeing things because i'd never seen another double helix, but then you used a multi helix. It all came back to me." said Gavin. "the prophecy." "wha?" said Jacob "this doesn't make sence at all."
            
            Chapter 6: the explination
            
            "Ok I see this isn't making any sence, so how about I tell you the prophecy" said Gavin.
            
            "A boy escapes ash and smoke*, ten years later, the DARK HELIX will over run the land, and the multi helixed boy** will be the only hope for salvation"
            
            "so you are saying i'm the kid who escapes ash and smoke, but ho-" Jacob couldn't say anymore before John burst into the room with a burning torch in his hand. He leaped into the room and ran towards Gavin. His eyes blazing almost as brightly as the torch itself! 
            John ran so fast all Jacob could see of him was the quick stream of light that John's torch left behind, he yell loudly "Get out, get out! GET OUT!!!". It was amazing to see John being so athletic! Normally he would of ran, hid, or been a coward in some way, shape, or form.
            John ran behind Gavin and hopped up into the air! Gavin looked in surprise as John hit him squarely in the forehead with the butt of the torch. And that, of course was when his lights went out.
            
            *The Great SeaPort Fire
            **Jacob
            
            Chapter 7: Dude, you killed him.
            
            "Dude, you killed him!" exclamed Jacob. "I didn't kill him he's fine," replied John."look, he's still breathing." Just then Gavin let out a groan."See, still alive." said John."But we should run before this guy wakes up." "Good idea." replied Jacob. So the two boys ran back to town.
            
            ---hellodude---
            
            After their long trek through the wilderness (it actually took only a few minutes,but, to the boys it felt like a long time.), the boys finally made it back to the wonderful town of SeaPort, with ships heading to and from The Glipper Islands, a wonderful vacation spot*. "we're finally home!" said Jacob not realizing that the trek through the forest only lasted a few minutes. "dude, we should get back to town." said John thinking about the possibility that Gavin had woken up and was chasing them and the thought of going back to town made him feel better inside. Just then they heard foot steps behind them and they ran.
            
            *The Glipper Islands were the only area in Haddixia left unclaimed by the Canners or the Petersons, so it was really the only place where there was peace between the two tribes.

            @B2sneakpeek Chapter 1:
            John and Jacob ran back to town and when they got there it was empty*. No other Haddix in sight absolutly ZERO Helix commotion, just a bunch of trash and litter left behind from some quick evacuation "Why would the Seafolk want to leave? SeaPort was one of the most successful towns in Haddixia." said Jacob, John didn't reply, Jacob looked where John was only to find that he was not there!
