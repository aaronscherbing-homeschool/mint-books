        <p>"I LOVE THIS WEBSITE!!!" you may have heard from the comments. If not that extreme, 
            you probably just like this website because of the stories that are on this website.
        </p>
        <p>This website came from another website called Sibling Stories (It's not deployed 
            so don't try to visit it!!!) When suddenly I got an idea, "What if I made a 
            better version of this?" Now, this was the same thing I did with Videshare,
        so it was pretty easy to do. I just changed the colors, made a logo and called it 
    Mint Books!</p>
